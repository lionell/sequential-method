## Getting started
It's a prover of logical formulas. Core of application is Sequential Method algorithm.
Let's look closer how it works!

## How it works
Application is divided in several independent modules:
  1. [Parser][1-1] parse input string into AST.
     1. [Tokenizer][1-1-1] split input expression into lexemes.
     2. [Infix-to-Postfix converter][1-1-2] converts infix list of lexemes
        to RPN(Reverse Polish Notation).
     3. [Abstract Syntax Tree generator][1-1-3] converts list of
        tokens(token = lexeme + additional information) to tree.
  2. [Sequential method][1-2] logic of application.
  3. [Wrapper][1-3] wrap results of Sequential method to unique data structure for
        mapping to JSON.

[1-2]: /src/main/java/io/github/lionell/utils/SequentialMethod.java
[1-3]: /src/main/java/io/github/lionell/utils/WrapBuilder.java

Now let's move to the heart for application.

### Algorithm
Here are description of one algorithm iteration.
  1. If all leaves are closed, **finish with positive verdict**.
  2. If all leaves are atomic, **finish with negative verdict**.
  3. For each non-atomic, non-closed leaf.
    1. Expand leaf.
    2. Simplify result leaves.
  4. Goto step 1

There is situation when algorithm will go to **INFINITE LOOP**.
In this case we can use [KÃ¶nig's infinity lemma][kenigs] to say
about **finish with negative result**.

-->          |-{A->B}, &#931;          |+A, -B, &#931;|

### Let's look at examples
#### Example 1
First example demonstrates how exactly sequences is expanding when implication
and disjunction are in charge.
```
                                              P[x] = P[x] || Q[x]
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                            -{P[x] -> P[x] || Q[x]}
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                            +P[x], -{P[x] || Q[x]}
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                             -P[x], -Q[x], +P[x]
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                                      X
```
As you can see sequential tree has only one branch, and it's closed.
According to algorithm above, expression is **truthful**.
It's quite simple example, so let's move to something more interesting.

#### Example 2
Here is more complicated example with quantifiers.
It's also truthful, but now we have two different closed branches.
```
                                           #xP[x] -> Q[x] = P[x] -> #xQ[x]
                                                          |
                                                          v
                                        -{(#xP[x] -> Q[x]) -> P[x] -> #xQ[x]}
                                                          |
                                                          v
                                        +{#xP[x] -> Q[x]}, -{P[x] -> #xQ[x]}
                                       /                                   \
                                      /                                     \
                                     v                                       v
                        -#xP[x], -{P[x] -> #xQ[x]}                 +Q[x], -{P[x] -> #xQ[x]}
                                    |                                         |
                                    v                                         v
                    -P[x], -{P[x] -> #xQ[x]}, -#xP[x]                +P[x], -#xQ[x], +Q[x]
                                    |                                         |
                                    v                                         v
                     +P[x], -#xQ[x], -P[x], -#xP[x]               -Q[x], +P[x], +Q[x], -#xQ[x]
                                    |                                         |
                                    v                                         v
                                    X                                         X
```
As you can see all two branches closed at the same time. So expression is
truthful and no counter examples exists.

#### Example 3
This example show you how to deal with unclosed sequences, and how to get a
counter example.
```
                                            P[x] -> #xQ[x] = #xP[x] -> Q[x]
                                                           |
                                                           v
                                          -{P[x] -> #xQ[x] -> #xP[x] -> Q[x]}
                                                           |
                                                           v
                                          +{P[x] -> #xQ[x]}, -{#xP[x] -> Q[x]}
                                         /                                   \
                                        /                                     \
                                       v                                       v
                           -P[x], -{#xP[x] -> Q[x]}                 +#xQ[x], -{#xP[x] -> Q[x]}
                                      |                                         |
                                      v                                         v
                            +#xP[x], -Q[x], -P[x]                    +Q[z], -{#xP[x] -> Q[x]}
                                      |                                         |
                                      v                                         v
                             +P[y], -Q[x], -P[x]                      +#xP[x], -Q[x], +Q[z]
                                                                                |
                                                                                v
                                                                       +P[w], -Q[x], +Q[z]
```

##### Left branch

| name |  delta  |      values        |
|:----:|:--------|:-------------------|
|      | x -> a, | P\[a\] := *False,* |
|  A   | y -> b  | P\[b\] := *True,*  |
|      |         | Q\[a\] := *False*  |

Let's try to build interpretation on this counter example. There are many
different options, but we can stop on:
```
x := integer
P[x] := x == 1
Q[x] := x != x                // always false
```

##### Right branch

| name |  delta  |      values       |
|:----:|:--------|:------------------|
|      | x -> a, | Q\[a] := *False,* |
|  B   | z -> b, | Q\[b] := *True,*  |
|      | w -> c  | P\[c] := *True*   |

In this case we can use next interpretation:
```
x := integer
P[x] := (x + x) % 2 == 0      // always true
Q[x] := x % 2 == 1
```

##### Summary
We have got two unclosed branches. Each one produces unique counter example.
Each counter example can give us many different interpretations. We have
already built some of them. You can manually check these interpretations,
to ensure that expression is false. Just evaluate input expression with these
interpretations.

Let's stop at this example and move forward to syntax overview.

## Language specification
This is language grammar in [Backus-Naur-Form][bnf].
[bnf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form
```HTML+PHP
<expression>				::= <formula> "=" <formula>
<formula>					::= [ "(" ] <predicate>
                                        | <logical-operation>
                                        | <quantifier>
                                [ ")" ]
<predicate> 				::= <predicate-name> "[" <variable-arguments> "]"
<predicate-name>			::= <capital-letter> { <letter> }
<predicate-arguments> 		::= <variable-name> { "," <variable-name> }
<variable-name> 			::= <letter> { <letter> }

<logical-operation>			::= <unary-operation>
                                | <binary-operation>
<binary-operation>			::= <formula> <binary-operation-keyword> <formula>
<binary-operation-keyword>	::= "&&"
                                | "||"
                                | "->"
<unary-operation>			::= "!" <formula>

<quantifier>				::= <quantifier-keyword> <predicate-name> <formula>
<quantifier-keyword>		::= "#"       comment stands for "exists"
                                | "@"     comment stands for "for all"

<letter>					::= "a"
                                | "b"
                                | ...
                                | "z"
<capital-letter>			::= "A"
                                | "B"
                                | ...
                                | "Z"
```

If your expression **does not fit** this grammar then application will rise an
parser exception and inform you with `error` field of response.

### Valid expressions
Some valid examples of expressions:
  * `P[x] = Q[x]`
  * `P[x] = P[x] || Q[x]`
  * `#xP[x] -> Q[x] = P[x] -> #xQ[x]`
  * `#x@yP[x, y] = @y#xP[x, y]`
  * `P[x] -> #xQ[x] = #xP[x] -> Q[x]`

## API
There are only one service available, named `check`. To use it your query
should contains field named `expr` with expression you want to check.
Both `get` and `post` methods are supported.

### API Usage
Simple request `check?expr=P[x]=P[x]||Q[x]` will give you response
listed below.

```JSON
{
   "tree":{
      "root":{
         "formulas":[
            {
               "formula":"(P[x]) -> ((P[x]) || (Q[x]))",
               "value":false
            }
         ],
         "children":[
            {
               "formulas":[
                  {
                     "formula":"P[x]",
                     "value":true
                  },
                  {
                     "formula":"(P[x]) || (Q[x])",
                     "value":false
                  }
               ],
               "children":[
                  {
                     "formulas":[
                        {
                           "formula":"Q[x]",
                           "value":false
                        },
                        {
                           "formula":"P[x]",
                           "value":false
                        },
                        {
                           "formula":"P[x]",
                           "value":true
                        }
                     ],
                     "children":[],
                     "closed":true
                  }
               ],
               "closed":false
            }
         ],
         "closed":false
      }
   },
   "verity":true,
   "examples":null,
   "error":null
}
```

Now let's look closer to response structure.

### response
```JSON
"tree":         sequential tree
"verity":       true,               if expression is truthful
                false,              if expression is false
                null,               if infinite loop detected
"examples":     null,               if expression is truthful
                counter example,    otherwise
"error":        error message,      if error occurred
                null,               otherwise
```

### node
```JSON
