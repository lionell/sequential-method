## Getting started
It's a prover of logical formulas. Core of application is Sequential Method algorithm.
Let's look closer on application architecture. Project is divided in several independent
modules: Tokenizer, Infix-To-Prefix converter, AST generator, Sequential method and Wrapper.

## How it works
Application is divided in several independent modules:
 1. [Parser][1-1] parse input string into AST.
    1. [Tokenizer][1-1-1] split input expression into lexemes.
    2. [Infix-to-Postfix converter][1-1-2] converts infix list of lexemes
        to RPN(Reverse Polish Notation).
    3. [Abstract Syntax Tree generator][1-1-3] converts list of
        tokens(token = lexeme + additional information) to tree.
 2. [Sequential method][1-2] logic of application.
 3. [Wrapper][1-3] wrap results of Sequential method to unique data structure for
        mapping to JSON.

 [1-2]: /src/main/java/io/github/lionell/utils/SequentialMethod.java
 [1-3]: /src/main/java/io/github/lionell/utils/WrapBuilder.java

Now let's move to the heart for application.

### Algorithm
Here are description of one algorithm iteration.
 1. If all leaves are closed, **finish with positive verdict**.
 2. If all leaves are atomic, **finish with negative verdict**.
 4. For each non-atomic, non-closed leaf.
    1. Expand leaf.
    2. Simplify result leaves.
 5. Goto step 1

There is situation when algorithm will go to **INFINITE LOOP**.
In this case we can use **Kenig's lemma** to say
about **finish with negative result**.

Now let's look closer at examples.

**Example 1.** First example, has only one branch. It shows how exactly
sequences is expanding when implication and disjunction are in charge.
```C
                                              P[x] = P[x] || Q[x]
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                            -{P[x] -> P[x] || Q[x]}
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                            +P[x], -{P[x] || Q[x]}
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                             -P[x], -Q[x], +P[x]
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                                      X
```
This is very simple example. Let's look on something harder.

**Example 2.** Here is more complicated example with quantifiers.
It's also truthful, but now we have two different closed branches.
```
                                           #xP[x] -> Q[x] = P[x] -> #xQ[x]
                                                          |
                                                          v
                                        -{(#xP[x] -> Q[x]) -> P[x] -> #xQ[x]}
                                                          |
                                                          v
                                        +{#xP[x] -> Q[x]}, -{P[x] -> #xQ[x]}
                                       /                                   \
                                      /                                     \
                                     v                                       v
                        -#xP[x], -{P[x] -> #xQ[x]}                 +Q[x], -{P[x] -> #xQ[x]}
                                    |                                         |
                                    v                                         v
                    -P[x], -{P[x] -> #xQ[x]}, -#xP[x]                +P[x], -#xQ[x], +Q[x]
                                    |                                         |
                                    v                                         v
                     +P[x], -#xQ[x], -P[x], -#xP[x]               -Q[x], +P[x], +Q[x], -#xQ[x]
                                    |                                         |
                                    v                                         v
                                    X                                         X

```
As you can see all two branches closed at the same time. So expression is
truthful and no counter examples exists.

**Example 3.** This example show you how to deal with unclosed sequences, and
how to get a counter example.
```
                                            P[x] -> #xQ[x] = #xP[x] -> Q[x]
                                                           |
                                                           v
                                          -{P[x] -> #xQ[x] -> #xP[x] -> Q[x]}
                                                           |
                                                           v
                                          +{P[x] -> #xQ[x]}, -{#xP[x] -> Q[x]}
                                         /                                   \
                                        /                                     \
                                       v                                       v
                           -P[x], -{#xP[x] -> Q[x]}                 +#xQ[x], -{#xP[x] -> Q[x]}
                                      |                                         |
                                      v                                         v
                            +#xP[x], -Q[x], -P[x]                    +Q[z], -{#xP[x] -> Q[x]}
                                      |                                         |
                                      v                                         v
                             +P[y], -Q[x], -P[x]                      +#xP[x], -Q[x], +Q[z]
                                                                                |
                                                                                v
                                                                       +P[w], -Q[x], +Q[z]
```
We have got two unclosed branches. Each one produces unique counter example:

|------|---------|---------------|
| name |  delta  |    values     |
|      | x -> a, | P\[a]:=False, |
|  A   | y -> b  | P\[b]:=True,  |
|      |         | Q\[a]:=False  |
|------|---------|---------------|
|      | x -> a, | Q\[a]:=False, |
|  B   | z -> b, | Q\[b]:=True,  |
|      | w -> c  | P\[c]:=True   |
|------|---------|---------------|

```
Counter example A
delta:
         x -> a,
         y -> b
values:
         P[a]:=False
         P[b]:=True
         Q[a]:=False
Counter example B
delta:
         x -> a,
         z -> b,
         w -> c
values:
         Q[a]:=False
         Q[b]:=True
         P[c]:=True
```

## Formal Language Specification
This is language grammar in Backus-Naur-Form.
```HTML+PHP
<expression>				::= <formula> "=" <formula>
<formula>					::= [ "(" ] <predicate>
                                        | <logical-operation>
                                        | <quantifier>
                                [ ")" ]
<predicate> 				::= <predicate-name> "[" <variable-arguments> "]"
<predicate-name>			::= <capital-letter> { <letter> }
<predicate-arguments> 		::= <variable-name> { "," <variable-name> }
<variable-name> 			::= <letter> { <letter> }

<logical-operation>			::= <unary-operation>
                                | <binary-operation>

<letter>					::= "a"
                                | "b"
                                | ...
                                | "z"
<capital-letter>			::= "A"
                                | "B"
                                | ...
                                | "Z"
```

### Valid examples
Some valid examples of expressions:
 * `P[x] = Q[x]`
 * `P[x] = P[x] || Q[x]`
 * `#xP[x] -> Q[x] = P[x] -> #xQ[x]`
 * `#x@yP[x, y] = @y#xP[x, y]`
 * `P[x] -> #xQ[x] = #xP[x] -> Q[x]`

## API
There are only one service available, named `check`. To use it your query
should contains field named `expr` with expression you want to check.
Both `get` and `post` methods are supported.

### How to use API
Simple request `check?expr=P[x]=P[x]||Q[x]` will give you response
listed below.

```JSON
{
   "tree":{
      "root":{
         "formulas":[
            {
               "formula":"(P[x]) -> ((P[x]) || (Q[x]))",
               "value":false
            }
         ],
         "children":[
            {
               "formulas":[
                  {
                     "formula":"P[x]",
                     "value":true
                  },
                  {
                     "formula":"(P[x]) || (Q[x])",
                     "value":false
                  }
               ],
               "children":[
                  {
                     "formulas":[
                        {
                           "formula":"Q[x]",
                           "value":false
                        },
                        {
                           "formula":"P[x]",
                           "value":false
                        },
                        {
                           "formula":"P[x]",
                           "value":true
                        }
                     ],
                     "children":[],
                     "closed":true
                  }
               ],
               "closed":false
            }
         ],
         "closed":false
      }
   },
   "verity":true,
   "examples":null,
   "error":null
}
```

Now let's look closer to response structure.

### response

                null,               if infinite loop detected
"examples":     null,               if expression is truthful
                counter example,    otherwise
"error":        error message,      if error occurred
                null,               otherwise
```

### node
```JSON
"formulas":     list of formulas

"value":        true,               if formula holds true
                false,              otherwise
```

### examples
```JSON
"name":         name of example
"delta":        map with new
                variables

```

## Installation
### Requirements
 * Java Runtime Environment with Java SE8 support
 * Maven 3 to build

### Building
You can build app using Maven with ease. Just type `mvn clean package`.
This will generate JAR file `target/sequential-method-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

### Running
If you are using Maven, you can run application without building using
`mvn spring-boot:run`.

Or if you have pre-built JAR you can run it by typing:

`java -jar target/sequential-method-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`


### How to use
Now that the service is up, visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/),
where you see main page.

Write expression you want to check to marked textarea, and click
submit button.

Next page will show you result of sequential method applied to your expression.
Here you can find picture of sequential tree, verdict, counter example(if exists)
or error message.

## Used technologies
Here is a list of materials used in app:
 * [d3.js](http://d3js.org) visualizing sequential tree
 * [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net) design of main page
 * [Spring](https://spring.io/) framework
